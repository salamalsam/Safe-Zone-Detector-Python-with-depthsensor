"# Safe-Zone-Detector-Python-with-depthsensor" 

Smart Safety Detection System designed to detect safety areas and measure distances between objects in real-time. Initially built for human detection, this system continuously monitors the environment, alerting users when they enter a designated warning or danger zone.
Using depth sensor technology, the system provides precise feedback, ensuring that users are aware of potential risks before they become critical. Whether for personal safety or advanced applications in public spaces, this research aims to enhance situational awareness and proactive safety measures.
